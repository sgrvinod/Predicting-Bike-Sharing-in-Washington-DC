# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-in-Washington-DC
Non-Linear Regression algorithm in a Neural Network to forecast public bicycle mobility in Washington DC based on the time of the year, weather and other special events. Achieved a standard error of 3 people.

**Modeled in Matlab and R.**

*Note: This uses a first principles, hardcoded implementation of neural networks I wrote in Matlab and R. Initial data preparation code is found in the Main R file. Some simple preprocessing was done in Excel as well. I have also included a Linear Regression implementation in R, although linear regression was not used.*
